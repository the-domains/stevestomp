It's that wonderful moment: you've poured days and weeks (maybe even months) into building an amazing app, and it's finally ready to share with the world. All you have to do is submit it to the App Store, and how hard could that be, right?

Cue mountains of grunt work, trying to capture all the necessary screenshots for all supported devices, in all supported languages. Aaargh! The frustration builds, and you think: isn't there a better way?

If only you could run a single command that takes all your screenshots, on all your supported devices, in all your supported languages automagically. If only you could run a single command to upload those screenshots, generate your provisioning profiles and submit your app. Think of all the time you'd save!

Thanks to the awesome [Felix Krause,][0]there's now a tool to do all that and more. It'll become your new best friend.
